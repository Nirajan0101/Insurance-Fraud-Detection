# Insurance-Fraud-Detection

1. Aim is to leverage historical insurance claims data to build a 
predictive model for fraud detection. By analyzing patterns and 
trends in the data, we intend to develop an efficient system 
capable of distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent 
claims.
2. The project will involve data pre-processing, exploratory data 
analysis, feature engineering, and the implementation of machine 
learning algorithms for classification tasks.
3. To achieve our goal, we will utilize various Python libraries for 
data manipulation, visualization, and model building
